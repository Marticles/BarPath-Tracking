## Description  
        
There are 9 different trackers you can choose to track the barbell path, including BOOSTING, MIL,KCF, TLD, MEDIANFLOW, GOTURN, Dlib_Tracker, CamShift and Template_Matching. Not only the barbell path, you can also use these trackers to track other object, like a car or anything else.
    
关于这个简单的追踪器的中文说明在这里：[(｡･ω･｡) 点我点我](http://marticles.github.io/2018/05/05/基于OpenCV与Dlib的杠铃轨迹追踪器/)

## Start Tracking    
Firstly You need to create a bounding box around the bar(or the obeject) to be tracked. Click the left mouse button to select the bounding box.Then press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to start the tracking. If you want to close the video, just press <kbd>Esc</kbd>. I hope this simple program can help you to lift more weights.   

## Comparison
The comparison results are as follows.
